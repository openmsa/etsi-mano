In case of discrepancies the published ETSI Group Specification takes precedence.  In clause 4.3.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 v2.4.1, an attribute-based filtering mechanism is defined. This mechanism is currently not included in the corresponding OpenAPI design for this GS version. Changes to the attribute-based filtering mechanism are being considered in v2.5.1 of this GS for inclusion in the corresponding future ETSI NFV OpenAPI design.
