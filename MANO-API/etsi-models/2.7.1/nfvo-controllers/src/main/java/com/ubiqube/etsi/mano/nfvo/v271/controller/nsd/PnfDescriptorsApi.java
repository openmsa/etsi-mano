The default format of the ZIP file shall be the one specified in ETSI GS NFV-SOL 004 where only the YAML files representing the PNFD, and information necessary to navigate the ZIP file and to identify the file that is the entry point for parsing the PNFD and (if requested) further security information are included. This means that the content of the ZIP archive shall contain the following files from the PNFD archive: • TOSCA.meta (if available in the PNFD archive); • the main service template (either as referenced from TOSCA.meta or     available as a file with the extension \".yml\" or \".yaml\" from the     root of the archive); • every component of the PNFD referenced (recursively) from the main     service template; • the related security information, if the \"include_signatures\" URI     parameter is provided, as follows:     - the manifest file;     - the singleton certificate file in the root of the PNFD archive         (if available in the PNFD archive);     - the signing certificates of the individual files included in the         ZIP archive (if available in the PNFD archive);     - the signatures of the individual files (if available in the PNFD archive).
