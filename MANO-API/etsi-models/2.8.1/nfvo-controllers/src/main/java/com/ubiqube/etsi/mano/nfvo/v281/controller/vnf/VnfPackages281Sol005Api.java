NOTE 2: For a VNFD based on YANG, it includes the file as indicated by the \"yang_definitions\" keyname  in the metadata section of the main yaml file as described in ETSI GS NFV-SOL 004. - The related security information, if the \"include_signatures\" URI parameter is provided, as follows:   - the manifest file;   - the singleton certificate file in the root of the VNF package (if available in the package);   - the signing certificates of the individual files included in the ZIP archive (if available in the package);   - the signatures of the individual files (if available in the package). Tree examples are provided below. NOTE 3: These examples do not show the security related files. EXAMPLE 1: Assuming a request is sent for the following VNF package (as described in clause A.1 in ETSI GS NFV-SOL 004): !------TOSCA-Metadata !------TOSCA.meta (metadata for navigating the ZIP file) !------Definitions         !----- MRF.yaml (main VNFD file)         !----- OtherTemplates (e.g. type definitions referenced by the main VNFD file)  !------Files         !----- ChangeLog.txt         !----- image(s)         !----- other artifacts  !------Tests         !----- file(s)  !------Licenses         !----- file(s)  !------Scripts         !----- install.sh !----- MRF.mf The NFVO will return a ZIP file of the following format: !------TOSCA-Metadata         !------TOSCA.meta  !------Definitions         !----- MRF.yaml         !----- OtherTemplates  EXAMPLE 2: Assuming a request is sent for the following VNF package (a VNF package without a TOSCA Metadata directory,  as described in clause A.2 in ETSI GS NFV-SOL 004): !------MRF.yaml (main VNFD file) !------MRF.mf !------ChangeLog.txt !------Tests         !----- file(s)  !------Licenses         !----- file(s)  !------Artifacts         !----- install.sh         !----- start.yang  The NFVO will return a ZIP file of the following format: !------MRF.yaml EXAMPLE 3: Assuming a request is sent for the following VNF package (a VNF package with the YANG VNFD without a  TOSCA-Metadata directory, as described in clause A.3 in ETSI GS NFV SOL 004): !----CompanyVNFD.yaml !----CompanyVNFD.xml !----CompanyVNFD.mf !----ChangeLog.txt !-----Files !-----Instance Data Files         !----start.xml  !-----Licenses !-----Scripts         !-----install.sh  The NFVO will return a ZIP file of the following format: !----CompanyVNFD.yaml !----CompanyVNFD.xml (indicated in the yang_definitions metadata in CompanyVNFD.yaml) ", tags = {})
