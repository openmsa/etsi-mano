The default format of the ZIP file shall be the one specified in ETSI GS NFV-SOL 004 where only the YAML files representing the VNFD, and information needed to navigate the ZIP file and to identify the file that is the entry point for parsing the VNFD (such as TOSCA-meta or manifest files or naming conventions) are included.
